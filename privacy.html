                Personal Information collected for the joint sale or product
                promotion. TRAINMIND recommends you to review the privacy
                policies of these partners to address any questions you have

                If you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend
                about our products or services, we will ask you for the friend’s
                contact information. TRAINMIND will then send your friend a
                one-time contact related to your referral request. TRAINMIND
                uses the Personal Information you provide in this situation
                solely for the purpose of sending the one-time contact and
                tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may
                contact TRAINMIND through our inquiry form to be removed from
                the referral program.
                <br /><br />
                TRAINMIND may communicate with you about a conference or event
                hosted or co-sponsored by TRAINMIND or one of its partners.
                <br /><br />
                TRAINMIND also may share Personal Information with third parties
                who provide services to TRAINMIND, such as credit card

                only for the purpose of providing services to us and subject to
                terms consistent with this Policy.
                <br /><br />
                TRAINMIND may disclose your Personal Information as we believe
                to be necessary or appropriate:
                <br /><br />
                (a) under applicable law, including laws outside
                your country of residence; <br /><br />
                (b) to comply with legal
                process; <br /><br />
                (c) to respond to requests from public and
                government authorities, including public and government
                authorities outside your country of residence; <br /><br />
                (d)
                to enforce TRAINMIND’s terms and conditions; <br /><br />
                (e) to
                protect TRAINMIND’s operations or those of any of TRAINMIND’s
                affiliates; <br /><br />
                (f) to protect TRAINMIND’s rights,
                privacy, safety or property, and/or that of its affiliates, you
                or others; and <br /><br />
                (g) to allow TRAINMIND to pursue
                available remedies or limit the damages that TRAINMIND may
                sustain. 
                Additionally, TRAINMIND may decide to sell, buy, merge
                or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a
                transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the
                disclosure of Personal Information to prospective or actual
                purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is TRAINMIND’s
                practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these
                types of transactions.

            To enhance the user experience with TRAINMIND’s website,
                TRAINMIND may use “cookies.” Cookies are text files that
                TRAINMIND may place in your device that you use to access
                TRAINMIND’s website. Cookies are used to record various aspects
                of your visit and assist TRAINMIND to provide you with
                uninterrupted service.
                <br /><br />
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your
                preferences and other information on your computer in order to
                save your time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the
                same information and to display your personalized content and
                targeted advertising on your later visits to these sites.
                <br /><br />
                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
                browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
                modify the browser setting to decline cookies if the you so
                prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to
                sign in or use other interactive features of TRAINMIND’s website
                and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising
                preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be
                respected.
                <br /><br />
                If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to
                later delete cookies that you have accepted. For example, in
                Internet Explorer 8, you can delete cookies by selecting
                “Tools”, “Delete browsing history”. Then select the control box
                “Cookies” and click the “Delete” button. If you choose to delete
                cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those
                cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and
                may need to be recreated.
                <br /><br />
                TRAINMIND’s web pages may contain electronic images known as Web
                beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that may be used
                to assist in delivering cookies on TRAINMIND’s website and
                allows TRAINMIND to count users who have visited those pages and
                to deliver co-branded services. TRAINMIND may include Web
                beacons in promotional e-mail messages or TRAINMIND’s
                newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been
                opened and acted upon.
                <br /><br />
                TRAINMIND may also employ Web beacons from third parties in
                order to help TRAINMIND compile aggregated statistics regarding
                the effectiveness of TRAINMIND’s promotional campaigns or other
                operations of TRAINMIND sites. TRAINMIND prohibits Web beacons
                on its sites from being used by third parties to collect or
                access your Personal Information.
                <br /><br />
                Finally, TRAINMIND may work with other companies that advertise
                on TRAINMIND’s websites to place Web beacons on their sites in
                order to allow TRAINMIND to develop statistics on how often
                clicking on an advertisement on a TRAINMIND website results in a
                purchase or other action on the advertiser’s site.
